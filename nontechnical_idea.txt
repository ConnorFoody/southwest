A less technical, more available approach might be available. 

When you have a connecting flight you sometimes get bad priority on the
second flight. I assume that this is because other people have earlier
checkin times from the first leg of their flights and the checkin goes
all the way through your trip. If it is possible to get a partially 
refundable ticket you could book a long flight with a big layover or
something unreasonable (or barely reasonable), check in before anyone
else would reasonably checkin then cancel your first leg for a full
refund. If it isn't possible to get a partially refundable ticket 
(ie you are stuck paying nonrefundable prices) then this approach wouldn't
work.
